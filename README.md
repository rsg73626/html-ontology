# HTML Ontology

*Repository created for the final project of my master's subject "Knowledge Processing and Visualization".*

- This ontology is still in development. 

- It was based in the HTML specification of the version 5.2, that can be find [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/)

- The ontology was created using the [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu) software, so the file here can be imported in visualized on it.
